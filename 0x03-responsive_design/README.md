# 0x03-responsive_design

This project focuses on implementing responsive design principles for a website. The goal is to ensure the website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* A `README.md` file at the root of the project directory is mandatory.
* HTML and CSS have been rendered on Chrome 78 or more.
* The project utilizes the HTML and CSS starter files provided in the project description.

## Tasks

This project is broken down into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of responsive design.

### Task 0: Fix the hero banner (mandatory)

* **File:** `01-styles.css`
* **Description:** This task involves adjusting the CSS properties of the hero banner to ensure it is correctly displayed. The `background-position` and `background-size` properties within the `.hero-homepage` class selector are updated, and the `min-height` of the `.section-inner` within `.section-hero` is adjusted.

### Task 1: Add media queries (mandatory)

* **File:** `02-styles.css`
* **Description:** This task introduces media queries to the CSS. These queries will target different screen sizes and apply specific styles to ensure the layout adapts responsively. This will likely involve adjusting the width of the `.container` and the behaviour of the grid system (`.row` and `.col-*` classes) at various breakpoints.

### Task 2: Improve the navigation bar (mandatory)

* **File:** `03-styles.css`
* **Description:** This task focuses on enhancing the responsiveness of the navigation bar. On smaller screens, the navigation might need to transform into a more mobile-friendly layout, such as a hamburger menu. CSS will be used to implement this change and ensure smooth transitions.

### Task 3: Adapt the "Services" section (mandatory)

* **File:** `04-styles.css`
* **Description:** The "Services" section, which currently displays items in a row, needs to be adapted for smaller screens. This task will likely involve using media queries to change the layout of the service cards, perhaps stacking them vertically on mobile devices for better readability.

### Task 4: Make the "Works" section responsive (mandatory)

* **File:** `05-styles.css`
* **Description:** Similar to the "Services" section, the "Works" section needs to be responsive. This task will focus on adjusting the layout of the work portfolio items as the screen size changes, ensuring the images and descriptions are displayed effectively on different devices.

### Task 5: Style the "About Us" section for responsiveness (mandatory)

* **File:** `06-styles.css`
* **Description:** The "About Us" section, with its image and text columns, needs to be adapted for smaller screens. This task will likely involve using media queries to adjust the layout of these elements, possibly stacking them vertically on mobile to maintain readability.

### Task 6: Optimize the "Latest News" section (mandatory)

* **File:** `07-styles.css`
* **Description:** The "Latest News" section, displaying article cards, needs to be made responsive. This task will focus on ensuring the article cards are displayed appropriately on different screen sizes, potentially adjusting their width or stacking them on smaller devices.

### Task 7: Ensure "Testimonials" are responsive (mandatory)

* **File:** `08-styles.css`
* **Description:** The "Testimonials" section, showing quotes and avatars, needs to be responsive. This task will involve adjusting the layout of the testimonial cards to ensure they are well-presented on various screen sizes.

### Task 8: Adapt the "Contact" section (mandatory)

* **File:** `09-styles.css`
* **Description:** The "Contact" section needs to be responsive. This task will focus on ensuring the text and any form elements within this section adapt well to different screen sizes.

### Task 9: Final touches on the footer (mandatory)

* **File:** `10-styles.css`
* **Description:** The footer, with its logo, address, social links, and navigation, needs to be made responsive. This task will involve adjusting the layout of these elements to ensure they display correctly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Usage

To view the project, simply open the `index.html` file (or the relevant HTML file for each task) in a web browser that supports HTML5 and CSS3 (Chrome 78 or later is recommended). As you resize the browser window, you should observe the website adapting its layout to the different screen sizes.
